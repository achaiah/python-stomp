# stompy - Python STOMP client library #

This library is useful for connecting to and communicating with
Apache `ActiveMQ` (an open source `Java Message Service` (JMS)
message broker) or other brokers with support for the `STOMP` protocol.

The majority of the methods available take a single argument; a dictionary.
This dictionary should contain the necessary bits you need
to pass to the `STOMP` server.  It is outlined in each method
exactly what it needs to work.

For specifics on the protocol, see the `STOMP protocol specification`.

This library is basically a Python implementation of Perl's `Net::Stomp`.

To enable the `ActiveMQ` Broker for `STOMP` add the following to the
`activemq.xml` configuration:

    <connector>
        <serverTransport uri="stomp://localhost:61613"/>
    </connector>
